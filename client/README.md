# Pick a Random Student

1. Create a `form` with just 1 `input` to enter a student's name.
2. Upon `"submit"`, `push` the name onto _array_ (provided in 'scripts.js') **if** it's not already in there. You should use: [`find`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)
